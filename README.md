# Website Development

## modular programming in html and javascript

- baseurl = <https://jizhaoqin.github.io>
- all .md files in the first level would be transferred to .html files
- e.g. index.md -> index.html
- so as others.
- so we have baseurl(/index.html), baseurl/blog, baseurl/project, baseurl/test-page, baseurl/404, etc.
- and I think README.md and 404.md are required by default.
- TODO: but how to set a deeper level for the website? e.g. baseurl/blog/blog1
